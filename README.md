It currently runs on a web application deployment platform with a fully-automated process for provisioning and configuration. Architecturally, it is designed with a multi-tenant front-end and utilizes a dedicated database. The application also relies on external services and uses a cloud-supported PaaS database. The development team is skilled in cloud technologies and practices, with advanced expertise. The application is governed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with a specified maintenance timeframe and features multifactor authentication for user access. External exposure is facilitated through a REST API, and it currently operates in a hybrid state, with data consumption driven by data analytics needs.

# Loan Origination System

The application, developed as a custom solution by Dev, supports consumer lending and was first released in 2018. With significant business value, it has seen between 7 and 12 major releases in the last year and aligns well with the company's future technology direction. An average of 15 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) have contributed to the codebase over the past 12 months. This application primarily serves external users, reaching a sizable end-user base of approximately 501 to 2,500 individuals. While a failure of the application would have a medium-level impact on operational continuity and revenue, it would pose a high risk to the company’s public image and could lead to substantial loss of customer confidence.

In terms of cloud maturity, the application handles a Big Data workload and follows an Agile Development process for evolution and feedback. It is deployed as a mobile or tablet application with a fully automated provisioning and configuration setup. Architecturally, it is designed with a multi-tenant front-end backed by a dedicated database and depends on external services for certain functions. The database is cloud-supported, leveraging a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model. The development team is proficient in cloud technologies, possessing advanced skills and experience. The application operates under a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with a specified maintenance timeframe and employs multifactor authentication to secure user access. It interfaces with external services via a REST API and is in a hybrid operational state, with data primarily consumed through data analytics.

# HR Management System
The application, owned by Dev, is a custom-built solution released in 2020 and classified as "Other / Not Applicable" in terms of application type. In the past 12 months, it has seen 4 to 6 major releases, and it aligns with the company's future technology direction. On average, a team of five full-time employees (FTE) contributed to the codebase, and it serves both internal and external users, with an estimated user base of 100 to 500. Failure of this application could have a medium-level impact on business continuity, revenue, and customer confidence, although its effect on the company’s public image is considered low.

In terms of cloud maturity, the application corresponds to an unspecified workload and follows a Waterfall model for evolution and feedback loops. It is deployed as a web application but lacks automation for deployment provisioning and configuration processes. Designed with a multi-tenant front end and a dedicated database, it operates independently, with no dependencies on other applications or services. The database is provisioned via a standard Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, and the application supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for user authentication. The application is currently in a hybrid state, with standalone exposure to external services or applications. The development team’s skills in cloud technologies are considered basic, and the application’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) includes maintenance windows. Data consumption from the application is also categorized as "Other / Not Applicable."

# Recipe Portal
The application, owned by Dev, is a custom-built solution categorized as "Other" in terms of application type and was released in 2020. Over the last year, this application has had between 7 and 12 major releases, showcasing its active development and relevance to the company's future technological trajectory. The team supporting this application comprises approximately 10 full-time equivalents (FTEs), and it serves a mix of both internal and external users, with an estimated end-user base of 100 to 500 individuals.

Failure of the application would have a medium impact on operational continuity, with a high potential for loss in revenue or business opportunity. Moreover, such a failure could adversely affect the company’s public image, creating a significant risk to customer confidence.

In terms of cloud maturity, the application aligns with a microservices and containerized workload model and follows a DevOps approach to evolution and feedback loops. The deployment platform is semi-automated, web-based, and utilizes a multi-tenant front end combined with a dedicated database setup. Internally, the application interfaces with other services through an API, and its database is provided as a managed service in the cloud, ensuring reliability and scalability.

The development team is advanced in cloud technologies and practices, allowing the application to meet a current SLA with designated maintenance windows. Security is bolstered by a multifactor authentication mechanism, and the application communicates with external services through a REST API. Currently operating in a hybrid cloud state, data consumption from this application is focused on information management.

# Ticket Monster
The application in question is an eCommerce solution owned by a user referred to as "Tester" and is categorized as a custom-built system. It was released in 2018 and has had consistent development activity, with four to six major releases in the past year. This application aligns with the company's future technology goals and has involved an average team of 12 full-time employees over the last year. It serves both internal and external users, with an end-user base ranging from 100 to 500 individuals.
